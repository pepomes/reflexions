How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
diff points out the lines with a difference in the code.
It is then easy to check if the change is mandated
  or if it is a typo
It works very well on very large files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can 'rewind' to the point I have made the mistake
If I delete something by mistake, I can compare old versions
and restore the section.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
+I can choose which changes are relevant or not
+I can comment on changes which makes it easier to find
-Risk of not committing resulting in a chunk not committed

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
The purpose is different. In one case Git tracks an entire project, while in Google doc separate files are not linked together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use git log to get the history of all file
then git diff of the two file ids in git log

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Very confident. I can save each change, then revert back to the place the change was made.
